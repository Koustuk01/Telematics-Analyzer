## Features
- Load telematics data (CSV/JSON)
- Clean and preprocess data (interpolation, smoothing)
- Detect events: overspeeding, harsh braking, idling
- Visualize speed over time and route heatmap
- Export event logs as CSV


## Tech Stack
- Python 3.10+
- pandas, numpy
- plotly
- folium (optional for local maps)


## Installation
